# Play Drums:
- It's an online browser-based Drum-Kit with 7 instruments to play.
- The instruments can be either played using keyboard keys displayed on-screen or using a mouse.
- Each instrument is labeled with an alphabet & a corresponding instrument picture is given in the background.
- On every click, the click gets detected & a mapping of click to sound is carried out to play the exact sound intended.
